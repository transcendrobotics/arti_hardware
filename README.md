The Hardware ROS package for ARTI3 robot
## How to install
1. First add dialout to your user
```
$ sudo adduser "your_user_name" dialout
```

2. logout and log in.

3. install the package
```
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-serial ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realtime-tools
cd "your_workspace"/src
git clone https://github.com/transcendrobotics/arti_hardware.git
git clone https://github.com/transcendrobotics/arti_msgs.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```
## How to use it
Once you have the robot, and installed ROS and this package, you can simply do
```
roslaunch arti_hardware arit_base.launch
```
## How to control the robot
Simply just publish veloctiy command on "/cmd_vel" you should be able to control the robot, or you can publish a left and right voltage value to control it.
For example:
### Use keyboard
```
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-teleop-twist-keyboard
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```
See the instruction to control the robot.
### Use joystick
```
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-teleop-twist-keyboard
roslaunch teleop_twist_joy teleop_twist_joy.launch
```
## Notes
1. The code was capable with odometry from encoder but we don't want to use encoder anymore because track robots slip a lot.
2. The hardware doesn't have velocity control, the command sends to the robot is open loop, works as voltage command.
